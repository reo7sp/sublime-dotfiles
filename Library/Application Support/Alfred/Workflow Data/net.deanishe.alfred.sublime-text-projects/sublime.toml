# How many directories deep to search by default.
# 0 = the directory itself
# 1 = immediate children of the directory
# 2 = grandchildren of the directory
# etc.
# default: 2
#
# depth = 2


# How long to cache the list of projects for.
# default: 5m
#
# cache-age = "5m"


# git-style glob patterns of paths to ignore.
# default: []
#
# E.g.:
#
# excludes = [
#   "/Applications/*",
#   "**/vim/undo/**",
# ]

# Additional paths to search with "find".
# Each search path is specified by a [[paths]] header and requires a path value.
# E.g.:
#
[[paths]]
path = "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Projects"
#
# You can override the default depth:
#
#  [[paths]]
#  path = "~/Code"
#  depth = 3
